My ambition for Fairest Creature was simple: I wanted to create the best Cabernet Sauvignon ever. Not just from the Napa Valley or a certain vintage, not from one single winemaker, but the best Cabernet ever conceived.
 
Triniceros is our master blend. Michel Rolland has selected his favorite barrels from the Sine Fine, Polyspline, and Perihelios to creat this flagship cuve, only available in oversized formats. In the end, the real fairest creatures are not just mythical beasts on the labels, but the four talented individuals behind the creations.

Which damage total do you use to determine the life gain from lifelink? I had assumed that if a 3/3 creature with lifelink was blocked by a 2/2 creature that the life gain total would be 2, the maximum that the blocker can absorb before dying. This seems to be incorrect, as when I read the example attached to CR 119.4c
 
A creature with 10 power blocked by a creature with 1 toughness **deals 10 damage** to that poor little blocker. Creatures with 10 power are not known for their discretion or moderation; they don't deal 1 damage on the grounds that that will be enough to do the job. No, they smash that blocker into smithereens and leave behind a smoking crater!
